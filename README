Files related to the building of pyarza ordbot (AKA pyBot)

The "thepybot" folder contains:

 - The pdf files with the parts of the bot
   (made by bdring. see http://www.buildlog.net/)

 - My versions of those PDF files written with openScad
   (http://www.openscad.org/)
   This files are being made to make the 3D model of the pyBot (that is my ordBot)

 - Hopefully soon here will also come the STL files to be able to print the pieces
   and get an idea of what the bot will look like
